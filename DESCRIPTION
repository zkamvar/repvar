Description: In population genetics, it's not uncommon to re-genotype sets of
    samples to use as positive controls in future studies or for diagnostic 
    panels. To save cost, it's often desireable to have the minimum number of
    samples that represent all of the alleles in the data. This package provides
    a procedure that will select these samples with alternative options. The 
    name 'repvar' stands for 'REPresent VARiables'.
